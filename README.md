# Node.js Shop

This basic online shop is a node.js application powered by Express framework and EJS templating engine. It's the main project from [this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) and also an important part of my journey through Node-land. It covers the main features one would expect from a web store, such as user authentication and own products managing, products browsing, shopping cart and order history.
